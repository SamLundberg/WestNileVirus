# WestNileVirus
## Predicting the West Nile Virus in Chicago

The far-reaching effects of the mosquito carrying West Nile Virus can cause a city a great deal of money, both to spray to prevent, but also in medical costs if a person gets infected with the virus.  Are their patterns that link how, when, where the mosquitos that carry the WNV virus that can be identified so that proactive measures can be taken to minimize the effects?

Taking the dataset and challenge from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/), these questions and patterns are analyzed to see if predicting the WNV is possible.  The dataset is from 2007-2014, with the test sets being on the even years.  There is spray data in 2011 and 2013 only.  They also include weather data for the full period.
